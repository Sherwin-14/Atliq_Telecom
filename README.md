# AtliQo Telecom User Analysis

## Problem Statement

AtliQo, one of the leading telecom providers in India, launched its 5G plans in May 2022. Post the 5G launch, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth. The business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The aim is to compare the performance between these periods and derive insights that would enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other key metrics. They are also exploring the possibility of optimizing their internet plans to attract more active users.

## Project Overview

This project was undertaken by Peter Pandey, a junior data analyst, to address the above problem. The solution involved building a dashboard in Power BI and creating a presentation suggesting 11 recommendations based on the insights gained.

## Solution

### Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the user data, enabling easy comparison of KPIs between the pre and post 5G launch periods. It offers interactive visualizations that allow the management to understand the trends and patterns in the data.

### Recommendations

Based on the insights gained from the dashboard, a presentation was created outlining 11 recommendations for AtliQo. These recommendations aim to address the decline in active users and revenue growth, and suggest ways to optimize internet plans to attract more users.

## Future Work

This project serves as a starting point for AtliQo to understand their user behavior and make informed decisions. Future work will involve implementing the recommendations and monitoring their impact on the KPIs.
